## PickleLlama Studio

### Intro - For Everyone

First of all, if you've landed here, welcome to the nerd home of PickleLlama Studio. 

We have a weird name and there is a rather soft-chuckle fun story about where that came from. Needless to say it came from a shameless attempt to annoy a dearly beloved scrum master. 

You can read more about it [here](https://picklellama.studio/pickle-llama-say-what-now)

With that out of the way, here is the scoop on what we do:

We are a software engineering studio/lab/agency that specializes in solutions around generative AI for businesses that handle large amounts of information. 

If you are interested in working with us feel free to [reach out](mailto:john@picklellama.studio)

In all honesty though, [you might not want to](https://picklellama.studio/why-not-us), and that's ok too. We want to provide some resources, templates, and jumping off points for you to get started on your own. 

We believe in being the kind of business that you would recommend to a friend, and that you want to work with in the future even if we aren't a good fit right now. 

We wish you all the best and happy building!
